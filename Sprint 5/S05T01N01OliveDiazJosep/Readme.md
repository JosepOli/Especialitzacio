# Spring Boot - Sucursal Management System

This is a simple project that demonstrates a basic CRUD operation using Spring Boot, JPA, and Thymeleaf.

## Description

This Spring Boot application allows the user to manage sucursals (branches of a business). The user can view, add, update, and delete sucursals from the database. Each sucursal has a unique ID, a name, and a country. There's also a SucursalDTO that determines whether the sucursal belongs to a European Union country.
